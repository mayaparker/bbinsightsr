\usage{
plot_game_trends(
  games,
  home_team,
  away_team,
  game_break = c("timeout", "half", "num_breaks"),
  stat = c("points", "fouls", "assists", "shots_made", "shots_total", "threes_made",

}
\arguments{
\item{games}{A data frame of play-by-play data for one or more games.}

\item{home_team}{A string giving the home team's full name.}

\item{away_team}{A string giving the away team's full name.}

\item{game_break}{A string indicating the segmentation method. One of
\code{"timeout"}, \code{"half"}, or \code{"num_breaks"}.}

\item{stat}{The statistic to plot. One of:
\code{"points"}, \code{"fouls"}, \code{"assists"}, \code{"shots_made"},
\code{"shots_total"}, \code{"threes_made"}, \code{"threes_total"},
\code{"turnovers"}, \code{"steals"}, \code{"offensive_rebounds"},
\code{"defensive_rebounds"}, \code{"rebounds"},
\code{"fg_made"}, \code{"3pt_made"}, \code{"fg_attempts"},
\code{"3pt_attempts"}.}

\item{num_breaks}{(Optional) Integer. Required only if
\code{game_break = "num_breaks"}. Specifies how many evenly spaced segments to
create.}

\item{game_date}{(Optional) A string (format: \code{"YYYY-MM-DD"}) to identify a
specific game when multiple matchups exist between the teams.}
}
\value{
A \link[ggplot2]{ggplot} object showing the chosen stat by segment.
}
\description{
Plots a selected statistic (e.g., points, fouls, turnovers) for a single game
between two teams, segmented by timeouts, halves, or a user-specified number
of breaks.

\examples{
# Example 1: Plot with specific game date
plot_game_trends(
  games      = usu_data,
  home_team  = "Utah State",
  away_team  = "Wyoming",
  game_break = "timeout",
  stat       = "points",
  game_date  = "2023-01-10"
)

# Example 2: Plot without date (user selects game if multiple exist)
\dontrun{
plot_game_trends(
  games      = usu_data,
  home_team  = "Utah State",
  away_team  = "Nevada",
  game_break = "half",
  stat       = "rebounds"
