#' Analyze Free Throw Performance at a Home Team's Arena
#'
#' Summarizes and compares free throw performance by half for a specified home
#' team and their opponents in a particular arena. The function reports
#' free throw percentages for both the home and away teams across first and
#' second halves, and performs a t-test for the away team's performance by half.
#'
#' @param df A data frame of play-by-play data (e.g., from `ncaahoopR`) that
#' includes fields like `home`, `away`, `arena`, `free_throw`, `scoring_play`,
#' `half`, and `shot_team`.
#' @param home_team Character string specifying the name of the home team.
#' @param arena Character string specifying the name of the arena.
#'
#' @return A wide-format data frame (invisibly) with free throw percentages for
#' both home and away teams by half. The function prints a formatted summary
#' and a t-test comparing the away teamâ€™s first- and second-half free throw
#' percentages.
#'
#' @details If any team_type-by-half group has fewer than 15 observations, a
#' warning is issued indicating that the t-test may be unreliable for that
#' group.
