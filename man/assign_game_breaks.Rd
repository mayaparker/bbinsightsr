\title{Assign Game Segments Based on Break Type (Internal)}
\usage{
assign_game_breaks(
  game_data,
  segment_by = c("half", "timeout", "num_breaks"),
  num_breaks = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{game_data}{A data frame containing play-by-play data for a single game. Must include \code{play_id}, \code{description}, \code{half}, and \code{secs_remaining_absolute} columns.}

\item{segment_by}{A character string indicating how to segment the game. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"half"}: Breaks the game into 20-minute halves (plus OT if present).
\item \code{"timeout"}: Uses timeouts or "end" descriptions to define breaks.
\item \code{"num_breaks"}: Splits the game evenly into a specified number of breaks.
}}

\item{num_breaks}{An integer specifying how many breaks to create (required if \code{segment_by = "num_breaks"}).}
}
\value{
A modified version of the input data frame, including:
\item{\code{segment_id}}{An integer indicating which segment each row belongs to.}
\item{\code{game_break}}{Logical; \code{TRUE} if the row marks a break between segments.}
\item{\code{game_break_label}}{A string combining the break description and timestamp.}
}
\description{
Splits a single game's play-by-play data into sequential segments based on a selected break type.
Adds a \code{segment_id} to each row of the game and marks the appropriate rows as \code{game_break = TRUE}
to identify key game breaks (e.g., timeouts, halves, or custom intervals).
