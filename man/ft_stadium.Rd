\title{Analyze Free Throw Performance at a Home Team's Arena}
\usage{
ft_stadium(df, home_team, arena)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame of play-by-play data (e.g., from \code{ncaahoopR}) that
includes fields like \code{home}, \code{away}, \code{arena}, \code{free_throw}, \code{scoring_play},
\code{half}, and \code{shot_team}.}

\item{home_team}{Character string specifying the name of the home team.}

\item{arena}{Character string specifying the name of the arena.}
}
\value{
A wide-format data frame (invisibly) with free throw percentages for
both home and away teams by half. The function prints a formatted summary
and a t-test comparing the away teamâ€™s first- and second-half free throw
percentages.
}
\description{
Summarizes and compares free throw performance by half for a specified home
team and their opponents in a particular arena. The function reports
free throw percentages for both the home and away teams across first and
second halves, and performs a t-test for the away team's performance by half.
}
\details{
If any team_type-by-half group has fewer than 15 observations, a
warning is issued indicating that the t-test may be unreliable for that
group.
