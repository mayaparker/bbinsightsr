\title{Analyze Free Throw Performance by Half}
\usage{
ft_opponent(df, home_team, away_team, arena)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame of play-by-play data (e.g., from \code{ncaahoopR}) that
includes fields like \code{home}, \code{away}, \code{arena}, \code{free_throw}, \code{scoring_play},
\code{half}, and \code{shot_team}.}

\item{home_team}{Character string specifying the name of the home team.}

\item{away_team}{Character string specifying the name of the away team.}

\item{arena}{Character string specifying the name of the arena.}
}
\value{
A wide-format data frame (invisibly) with first- and second-half
free throw percentages for each team. The function prints a formatted
summary and the results of t-tests for within-team half comparisons.
}
\description{
Analyzes and summarizes free throw performance for both teams (home and
away) between two specific teams in a specific arena. The function provides
a summary table of free throw percentages by half, checks if groups have
sufficient sample sizes, and performs t-tests comparing first- and
second-half free throw accuracy for each team.
}
\details{
If any of the four shot_team-by-half combinations have fewer than
15 observations, a warning is issued noting which groups may produce
unreliable t-test results.
