\title{Assign Game Segments Based on Break Type (Internal)}
\usage{
assign_game_breaks(
  game_data,
  segment_by = c("half", "timeout", "num_breaks"),
  num_breaks = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{game_data}{A data frame containing play-by-play data for a single
game. Must include \code{play_id}, \code{description}, \code{half}, and
\code{secs_remaining_absolute} columns.}

\item{segment_by}{A character string indicating how to segment the game.
One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"half"}: Breaks the game into halves or OT periods.
\item \code{"timeout"}: Uses coach/official timeouts or "end" descriptions to
define breaks.
\item \code{"num_breaks"}: Splits the game evenly into a given number of
breaks.
}}

\item{num_breaks}{Integer (optional). Required if
\code{segment_by = "num_breaks"}.}
}
\value{
A modified version of \code{game_data} with columns:
\item{\code{segment_id}}{An integer indicating segment assignment.}
\item{\code{game_break}}{Logical TRUE/FALSE indicator for break rows.}
\item{\code{game_break_label}}{Label showing break and formatted time (MM:SS).}
}
\description{
Splits a single game's play-by-play data into sequential segments based on a
selected break type. Adds a \code{segment_id} to each row and marks
\code{game_break = TRUE} for key break events (e.g., timeouts, halftime, end of
game). Appends \code{game_break_label} with a consistent time.
